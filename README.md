# MemoryManagement README
Please run this MemoryManagement project in C++.

# Overview
This C++ program implements a memory management process that translates logical addresses to physical addresses using a page/frame table. The program also provides the page number and offset for a given logical address.

# Functionality
The memory management algorithm has the following functionality:
1. randomlogicalAddress function - randomly generates a logical address. This logical address will be used to calculate the physical address, page number, and offset.
2. 

# Instructions for Execution
1. Run this program in C++.
2. There is no user input to be entered to run the program.
3. Run the program and verify that up to 10 logical addresses can be generated with their respective physical addresses, page numbers, and offsets calculated.
4. Optional: Run the program many more times to verify that logical addresses are randomly generated along with their calculated physical addresses, page numbers, and offsets.
